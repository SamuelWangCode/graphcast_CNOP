See HRES-fc0 in the GraphCast paper for further description. Note that a 6h accumulation of precipitation is not available from HRES, so our model taking HRES inputs does not depend on precipitation. However, because our models predict precipitation, we include the ERA5 precipitation in the example data so it can serve as an illustrative example of ground truth.\n",
    "- We include ERA5 `toa_incident_solar_radiation` in the data. Our model use the radiation a -6h, 0h and +6h as a forcing term for each 1-step prediction. In an operational setting, one can compute the radiation using a package such as `pysolar`, if the +6h radiation is not readily available."
